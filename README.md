# Bussyc-Bus-Bunching-Optimiztion
This React Native app simulates and monitors the real-time movement of 5 buses along a 25 km route using time-stamped data. It integrates Greedy and Dynamic Programming (DP) techniques to provide intelligent speed adjustment suggestions for each bus, aiming to prevent bus bunching and maintain optimal spacing between consecutive buses.
